## Project implementation logic

I have started work with acquaintance with API, learning of project requirements and build implementation plan. I chose for development React, TypeScript and Material UI for styling.

## Implementation Plan

1. Create app using Create React App
2. Set up routing and clean up unused part of the react template app
3. Create Header component
4. Add useQuery to work with requests
5. Set up API Hooks to get data and models
6. Create Trend Page ( create layout for page, create Post component)
7. Create User Profile Page (create components for User Info and User Feed)
8. Handle errors from API

9. Posts paginated\*
10. Autoplay video on scrolling\*
11. Test coverage\*
12. Better error handling with snackbar global mechanism\*
13. Improve mobile version\*
14. Animation for video loading\*

I didn't have time to implement all the tasks (namely the items from the list above, marked \*: 9-14).
